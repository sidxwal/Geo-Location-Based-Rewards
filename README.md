# Geo-Location Based Rewards System  

## Overview  

The **Geo-Location Based Rewards System** is a blockchain-powered solution designed to incentivize users for visiting specific locations. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts on **Edu Chain**, this system ensures secure, transparent, and automated reward distribution based on user check-ins.  

## Features  

- **Blockchain-Powered**: Uses Ethereum smart contracts to ensure secure and immutable transactions.  
- **Geo-Location Rewards**: Users can check in with their latitude and longitude to earn rewards.  
- **Decentralized & Transparent**: No intermediaries, ensuring fair reward distribution.  
- **Real-World Engagement**: Encourages businesses, events, and communities to increase participation.  
- **Claimable Rewards**: Users can accumulate and redeem their rewards securely.  

## Smart Contract Deployment  

- **Deployed Address**: `0x4A2b83BE2613Bb233D4A286d6D1d737052Df7d6D`  
- **Blockchain Network**: Edu Chain  

## Use Cases  

- **Local Businesses**: Drive foot traffic to stores by rewarding visitors.  
- **Events & Conferences**: Increase participation with check-in incentives.  
- **Community Engagement**: Encourage real-world interactions with blockchain-based rewards.  

## How It Works  

1. Users visit a specific location and check in with their coordinates.  
2. The smart contract verifies the check-in and records the reward.  
3. Users can later claim their accumulated rewards.
